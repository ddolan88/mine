    <h3><i>A Short Biography</i></h3>
    <br>
    <p>I was in the Army and deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2007-2008, <mark>OIF<sup>7</sup> and OIF<sup>8</sup></mark>. While there I mostly did convoy security and qrf <ins>quick reaction force</ins> while volunteering at the mechanic shop on my days off to kill time. After that I came home and mostly did warehouse work. Lately I have had issues with warehouse jobs due to my left knee and decided it is time for a career that doesnt leave me in pain at the end of every day. I am originally from San Diego having moved away to the central valley area in 7th grade, <sub>maybe 8th</sub>. I will admit it is crazy to me to see how much has changed in such a short time. I am not sure where life will take me after this cousrse but I hope to always be moving in a direction that is adventageous <b>both</b> in work and in my personal life.

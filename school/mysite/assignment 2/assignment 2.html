    <h3><i>a short biography</i></h3>
    <br>
    <p>I was in the Army and deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2007-2008, <mark>OIF<sup>7</sup> and OIF<sup>8</sup></mark>. While there I mostly did convoy security and volunteered at the mechanic shop on my days off <ins>to kill time</ins>. After that I came home and mostly did warehouse work. Lately I have had issues with warehouse jobs due to my left knee and decided it is time for a career that doesnt leave me in pain at the end of every day. I am originally from San Diego having moved away to the central valley area in 7th grade, <sub>maybe 8th</sub>. I will admit it is crazy to me to see how much has changed in such a short time. I am not sure where life will take me after this cousrse but I hope to always be moving in a direction that is adventageous <b>both</b> in work and in my personal life.

    <h4>I got curious one day and decided to look up the translation of the Lorem Ipsum text</h4>
    <div class="btn-1"
        btn1-hover="The pain itself is important to the main adipisicing elite. We accuse the sage whence they are with us, and they do nothing. Whence comes the pleasure, the truth, what is this, and by what, unencumbered by these, that distinction is often followed by a just man, and not one of great importance? Whence, in the times of those who praise the present, great choice and pleasure will result from the pains due to guilt, and all pleasures will be easily condemned, and the annoyances of the corrupt follow. Great, let them be the hard work that everyone hates and you encounter him in the body of truth! The result is that no error can be made at the time of any resultant result, as it is, however. Please reject the pain and discomfort that is just the main consequence of them, and often accusing them of all of their major pain, resultant consequences follow the system. The hatred of labor is the annoyance of pleasure, there is nothing further than some annoyance.
